## How to git rebase a commit with secret

1. Use DOS Command Prompt and set notepad as the rebase editor.
git config --global core.editor "notepad"

2. Find out which commit/s has a secret and rebase it/them. 
    You can use git log but if you have many commits it would be difficult to use.
    2.1. In case you want to use git log:
        2.1.1. Run git log in the command prompt and use the arrow keys to see the red colored commits.
        2.1.2. Press Q or q to quit git log.

    2.2. In case you want to use Command Prompt: (Recommended)
        2.2.1. Run this command to start rebasing:
            git rebase -i <commit id>~1 
            git rebase -i 8afb710f~1

        2.2.2. The notepad will open the rebase file:
            pick 8afb710 Added Set-EnvVars module to Get-Tools and Cleanup-Tools modules and publish.ps1 file.
            pick b5a5ec0 #8 - Added missing powershell modules to the package.

        2.2.3. Replace pick wit edit. You can edit multiple commits at the same time.
            edit 8afb710 Added Set-EnvVars module to Get-Tools and Cleanup-Tools modules and publish.ps1 file.
            edit b5a5ec0 #8 - Added missing powershell modules to the package.

        2.2.3. Save and close the notepad.
        2.2.4. Remove the secret from your code. You need to manually search for the code that has the secret and 
               remove the secret or replace it by a placeholder.
        2.2.5. Stage, commit, pull and push:
            git add .
            git commit --amend
            git pull
            git push
            git push origin HEAD:<branch name>
            e.g.:
            git push origin HEAD:8-set-target-table-column-list-modal-window-component-not-working-properly

            or you can use the Git Changes window in Visual Studio if you are using it.

            Note: If there are multiple commits that you want to rebase, after amending a commit, continue on the next commit to rebase:
            git rebase --continue

            Repeat for each commit.

        2.2.6. If there are conflicts, you can use Visual Studio to fix the conflicts and merge them and finally commit and push them.
